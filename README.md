a facebook/twitter/discord bot that generates random memes by combining source images
with a meme template (it also does some other things)

i'm too lazy to explain it in detail atm so you'll have to figure it out on your own...

you can see the bot in action here:
* https://fb.com/lambdabot
* https://twitter.com/lambdabot3883
* https://discord.gg/halflife

third party software required for some functionality to work:
* imagemagick - for !dance command
* phantomjs - for cleverbot
